# Automatic repair/restore script
This is a lightweight and intuitive all-in-one script for restoring damaged software on your system, bringing together all those tools that the system itself provides to repair itself.
## Change language or translate
From the `config.properties` file you can change the language to an existing one.
If the language does not exist you can copy the `en.properties` file and translate it to your language.
You can find the language codes from [here](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) and rename the file according to the language you have translated it to.
## Change separator design and colors
From the `config.properties` file you can customize the script layout to your liking.

The first value represents the background color and the second the text color. For example: 80 *That would be gray background with black text.*
